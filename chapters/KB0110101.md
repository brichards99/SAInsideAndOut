What is a Clone?

At its most basic, this is the process of copying one ServiceNow database to another ServiceNow database. This makes it a process relevant to customers with more than one instance, which is most customers. It does not, as one can imagine, apply to Personal Development Instances.

Know your terms:
Source
Target
Preservers
Exclusion
